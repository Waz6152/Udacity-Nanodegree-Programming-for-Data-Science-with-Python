# Udacity Nanodegree - Programming for Data Science with Python

## Project 1 - Investigate a Relational Database
### Description
In this project, you will query the Sakila DVD Rental database. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
For this project, you will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching 
are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. 

## Project 2 - Explore US Bikeshare Data
### Description
In this project, you will write Python code to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project 3 - Post your Work on GitHub 
### Description
In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git. 
Here's an overview of your tasks for this project:

**Set Up Your Repository**
First, you'll fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.

**Improve Documentation**
Next, you'll practice creating branches using Git to make some changes to your project. In the real world, it's common to use different branches to manage the development of separate features or changes to a project. The first branch you'll work on is documentation. In this branch, you'll add project documentation in a README file, and make improvements to your docstrings for your bikeshare.py file. Then you'll push your commits back up to the remote repository.

**Refactor Code**
The next branch you'll be working on will be refactoring. Here, you can modify your bikeshare.py file to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of your code. You'll practice committing your code as you work on it, with at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages. Notice that this branch touches the code in your bikeshare.py file, while the documentation branch touches the docstrings in your file. This means you can work on these branches simultaneously without any conflicts! This is a common practice in the real world.

**Merge Branches**
Finally, once you are finished with your work, you can merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.
